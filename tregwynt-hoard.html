            The Tregwynt Hoard is a mid-17th-century hoard of coins found at Tregwynt Mansion near Fishguard in Pembrokeshire, Wales, in 1996. The hoard is now in National Museum Wales. The treasure consisted of 33 gold coins, 467 silver coins and a gold ring. This was the first English Civil War hoard found in Pembrokeshire.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Local history ==<br/><br/>This mansion had been the scene where the invasion of the French was first reported to Colonel Thomas Knox who was at a dance there on 23 February 1797. Knox, who had been appointed by his father William Knox went into a strategic withdrawal to Haverfordwest which is in land. The retreat of the Fishguard Fencibles was halted by Lord Cawdor who persuaded Knox to advance. The Fencibles who were local volunteers saw off the force of 1200 French convicts. It was reported the local population assisted in seeing off the "last invasion of British soil". The BBC reported that there was a local story that the guests at the dance hid their valuables and that when a hoard was discovered it was thought initially to have confirmed the tale.
