            Yosef Shenberger (Hebrew: יוסף שנברגר, also Schenberger; 1912 – 13 June 1982) was an Israeli architect. He designed many public buildings in the newly independent State of Israel including yeshivas, synagogues, hospitals and nursing homes, many of them in Jerusalem. Among his more notable projects are Mayanei Hayeshua Medical Center in Bnei Brak and, along with David Anatol Brutzkus, the new campus of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. He was involved in the restoration of many ancient ruins and religious sites, including the Kfar Bar'am synagogue, Western Wall Plaza and the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Yosef Shenberger was born in Frankfurt, Germany to Yehuda, a member of the Orthodox Jewish community founded by Samson Raphael Hirsch.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a result of Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Shenberger emigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1935, where he found work as an architect at Ma'atz, the Public Works Department of the Ministry of Transportation, which ultimately became the National Roads Company of Israel. In the 1940s, he designed the dormitory of the Mekor Haim yeshiva, and an industrial complex  <br/><br/>in Tel Arza on behalf of PAGI (not to be confused with Poalei Agudat Yisrael – PAI) a Haredi workers' organisation.<br/><br/>After the State of Israel was established in 1948, Shenberger served as deputy director of the Jerusalem Development Department at the Jewish Agency. After 1950, he started to work as an independent architect in Jerusalem, and became a member of the Planning and Construction Committee of the Jerusalem Municipality. In 1963, he was a panel member on the committee in charge of the competition to procure a design for the Jerusalem Municipality building.
