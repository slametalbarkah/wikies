            Pavlos Carrer (also Paolo Carrer; Greek: Παύλος Καρρέρ; 12 May 1829 – 7 June 1896) was a Greek composer, one of the leaders of the Ionian art music school and the first to create national operas and national songs on Greek plots, Greek librettos and verses, as well as melodies inspired by the folk and the urban popular musical tradition of modern Greece.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Carrer was a descendant of a noble family of Zante. He studied music in his birthplace with the Italian teachers Giuseppe Cricca, Francesco Marangoni and possibly in Corfu with Nikolaos Mantzaros. A natural musical talent, but also in harmony with the cultural atmosphere of the Ionian Islands of the time, which was dominated by Italian opera and western European culture, he composed his first small musical pieces in the late 1840s. The operatic 'scena' Il pellegrino di Castiglia attracted the public's attention when it was staged at the ‘Apollon’ Municipal Theatre of Zante.<br/><br/>In 1850, in the peak of the Risorgimento, the young Pavlos Carrer moved to Milan, the operatic capital of Europe (then under Austrian occupation), in order to specialize in his music studies. There he took private courses with Raimondo Boucheron, Pietro Tassistro and Giuseppe Winter. In the same year, he presented a concert at the ‘Carcano’ theatre with his first instrumental works. He also composed the music score for Tomaso Casati's ballet Bianca di Belmonte, produced at the ‘Teatro della Canobbiana’. Mentored by Francesco Lucca, the powerful Italian music publisher, Carrer made his debut as an opera composer in August 1852 at the ‘Carcano’, with Dante e Bice, an opera in three parts to a libretto by Serafino Torelli.
