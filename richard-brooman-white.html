<h1>Richard Brooman-White</h1>
            
            Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Charles Brooman-White 16 February 1912 – 25 January 1964) was a British journalist, intelligence agent and politician for the Conservative Party.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Education ==<br/><br/>The only son from a military family (his mother was a Texan), Brooman-White was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied economics and foreign languages, obtaining a good degree. On leaving university, he became a journalist, writing on politics and foreign affairs for Scottish newspapers. He was also a broadcaster on BBC radio.<br/><br/>On his father's side, he had a connection - although not by blood - to three other politicians: the 'White' suffix of the surname was added by Brooman's grandfather (also Richard) upon inheriting the country estate at Arddarroch, Loch Long (today part of the Finnart Oil Terminal facilities) from his stepfather John White (1810–1881), whose wealth derived from the J &amp; J White Chemicals factory near Rutherglen. John White was the uncle of Lord Overtoun who entered the peerage from 1893 and whose protégé was his own nephew, J. D. White, MP for Dunbartonshire in the 1910s. After the death of John White, Brooman-White's widowed great-grandmother Amelia married Lord Henry Lennox, although he died three years later.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Intelligence work ==<br/><br/>At the outbreak of the Second World War, Brooman-White was mobilised as a second lieutenant in the Dunbartonshire Light Anti-Aircraft unit, Royal Artillery. In 1940 he resigned his commission due to ill-health.
