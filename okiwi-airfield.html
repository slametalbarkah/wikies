            Okiwi Airfield (ICAO: NZOX), also called Okiwi Station Airfield, is a small airfield located near the village of Ōkiwi on Great Barrier Island, New Zealand. It has a single bitumen runway, and a small terminal in the form of a wooden hut. The airfield is owned by Auckland Council and is used for general aviation.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Okiwi Airfield originally consisted of a grass airstrip that was prone to flooding during bad weather and regularly had to be closed through the winter for periods up to eight months.<br/><br/>The Auckland Aero Club was the first operator to the airfield, services commencing by at least 1971. Great Barrier Airlines (now Barrier Air) began services to Okiwi in August 1984 after the Auckland Aero Club ceased Great Barrier Island operations, citing difficulties in turning profit.<br/><br/>In November 2013, work commenced on sealing the runway in order to alleviate these issues and attract more commercial operators to the airfield. The new runway took 6 months and $1.5 million to build. It opened on 2 May 2014.<br/><br/>Barrier Air, which had earlier rebranded from Great Barrier Airlines, ceased services to Okiwi in 2016.
