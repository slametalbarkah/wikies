            Máximo Gómez y Báez (November 18, 1836 – June 17, 1905) was a <br/><br/>Dominican Generalissimo in Cuba's War of Independence (1895–1898). He was known for his controversial scorched-earth policy, which entailed dynamiting passenger trains and torching the Spanish loyalists' property and sugar plantations—including many owned by Americans. He greatly increased the efficacy of the attacks by torturing and killing not only Spanish soldiers, but also Spanish sympathizers and especially Cubans loyal to Spain. By the time the Spanish–American War broke out in April 1898, the rebellion was virtually defeated in most of Western Cuba, with only a few operating pockets in the center and the east. He refused to join forces with the Spanish in fighting off the United States, and he retired to the Quinta de los Molinos, a luxury villa outside of Havana after the war's end formerly used by captains generals as summer residence.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Gómez was born on November 18, 1836, in the town of Baní, in the province of Peravia, in what is now the Dominican Republic. During his teenage years, he joined in the battles against the frequent Haitian incursions of Faustin Soulouque in the 1850s. He fought alongside the Spanish forces in the Dominican Restoration War (1863–1865), earning promotion from sergeant to commander in a famous victory over the Dominican general, Pedro Florentino.<br/><br/>He arrived in Cuba with the Spanish troops evacuated from Santo Domingo in 1865, starting an agricultural enterprise. In Cuba, he married Bernarda Toro, who accompanied him during the war.
