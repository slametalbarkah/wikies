            The Woolstore Theatre is a theatre in the village of Codford, Wiltshire, England. The theatre has been operating since 1928, when it was built by Colonel Ralph Sneyd for his wife who enjoyed acting.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Cinema ==<br/><br/>The old wool store was converted into a cinema around 1906, and named the Codford Empire Cinema. It provided entertainment to Australian troops during the First World War.<br/><br/>After the war, the cinema was turned into use as the village hall.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Theatre foundation ==<br/><br/>Colonel Ralph Sneyd was from a distinguished family, with a family seat of Keele Hall, Staffordshire (now Keele University), but following the death of his first wife, he was involved in a public scandal whilst attempting to divorce his second wife Irene Alexander on the grounds of adultery, which was widely reported in the press.<br/><br/>Sneyd bought a large property in Codford, which included ownership of the Woolstore. When he took a third wife, Dorothy Miller, known as Stella, who enjoyed acting, he converted it to a theatre. Stella formed a group called the Codford Amateurs, and their first play was performed at the Woolstore Theatre in 1928.<br/><br/>By 1938, the company had grown and came fourth out of more than 200 entries in a national contest.
