            Nicolás Factor (29 June 1520 – 23 December 1583) was a Spanish Roman Catholic priest and a professed member from the Order of Friars Minor as well as a painter of the Renaissance period. Factor served as an apt preacher across his region - despite wanting to be sent to the foreign missions - and was noted for his practices of self-mortification before he gave sermons.<br/><br/>Pope Pius VI beatified Factor on 27 August 1786.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Nicolás Factor was born in Valencia in Spain on 29 June 1520 as one of five children to a poor tailor.<br/><br/>In his childhood he fasted three times a week and donated all of his untouched food to the poor and also tended to the ill. He also visited a leper hospital. His Moorish maid was so affected with this that she learned about the faith and converted to Roman Catholicism. His father wanted him to follow his path, but Factor wanted to follow his own and so decided to become a priest and a religious.<br/><br/>He entered the Order of Friars Minor on 30 November 1537 and was sometime later ordained as a priest. He painted a range of devotional images.
