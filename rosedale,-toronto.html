            Rosedale is a neighbourhood in central Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was formerly the estate of William Botsford Jarvis, and so named by his wife, granddaughter of William Dummer Powell, for the wild roses that grew there in abundance. It is located north of Downtown Toronto and is one of its oldest suburbs. In 2013, Rosedale was ranked the best neighbourhood in Toronto to live in by Toronto Life. According to Today’s Senior Magazine, it is known as the area where the city's 'old money' lives, and is home to some of Canada's richest and most famous citizens including Gerry Schwartz, founder of Onex Corporation, Adrienne Clarkson, the 26th Governor General of Canada, and her husband, the author John Ralston Saul, as well as David Thomson, 3rd Baron Thomson of Fleet of the Thomson Corporation, the latter of whom is the richest man in Canada.<br/><br/>Rosedale's boundaries consist of the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks to the north, Yonge Street to the west, Aylmer Avenue and Rosedale Valley Road to the south, and Bayview Avenue to the east. The neighbourhood is within the City of Toronto's Rosedale-Moore Park neighbourhood. The neighbourhood is divided into a north and south portion by the Park Drive Ravine.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>South Rosedale was first settled by Sheriff William Jarvis and his wife, Mary, in 1826 after Jarvis inherited his father's home there two years earlier. Mary Jarvis, the granddaughter of chief justice and loyalist William Drummer Powell frequently walked and rode on horseback around the trails for that formed Rosedale's meandering streets (which are one of the area's trademarks).
