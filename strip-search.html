            A strip search is a practice of searching a person for weapons or other contraband suspected of being hidden on their body or inside their clothing, and not found by performing a frisk search, but by requiring the person to remove some or all clothing. The search may involve an official performing an intimate person search and inspecting their personal effects and body cavities (mouth, vagina, rectum, etc.). A strip search is more intrusive than a frisk and requires legal authority. Regulations covering strip searches vary considerably and may be mandatory in some situations or discretionary in others.<br/><br/>A strip search of a suspect of a recent violent crime  may additionally be useful for finding blood of the victim, signs of a fight, etc.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Legality of strip searches ==<br/><br/>In North America, civil lawsuits, as well as criminal code charges against strip searches have usually been successful when a person is strip searched by someone of the opposite sex, especially in cases where a woman has been strip searched by a male guard or guards.  The more disputed legal cases have often involved the presence of people of the other gender during a strip search.  Some of these cases have been less successful because of the legal technicality of who was actually performing the strip search, i.e. if more than one guard is present, the search is often (legally) said to be performed by the person or people giving the orders or instructions to the person or people being searched.<br/><br/>Another legal issue is that of blanket strip searches, such as in jails where detainees are routinely strip searched prior to conviction of a crime.
