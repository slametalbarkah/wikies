<h1>Titi Kwan</h1>
            
            Titi Kwan is a Hong Kong born, Paris-based fashion designer and wardrobe stylist. From the mid-1990s he worked closely with Chinese singer/actress Faye Wong as her stylist before moving to Paris to become a full-time designer in the early 2010s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Titi Kwan's father was a tailor who worked from home, specialising in traditional Chinese garments. Aged 15, he moved to Paris to stay with his sister, where he was able to express his individual sense of style without feeling out of place. At the age of 18, Kwan enrolled in the Studio Berçot in Paris, where he learned about the history of fashion, and developed his sewing, cutting and design skills under the eye of Marie Rucki. He worked as a waiter to pay his tuition fees, and also found additional work as a stylist, eventually leaving the Studio in order to focus full-time on this.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== As stylist ==<br/><br/>During a trip back home to Hong Kong in the mid-1990s, Kwan met Faye Wong whilst looking for a performer to feature in a fashion magazine. This was the beginning of a long-running partnership between Wong and her new stylist, Kwan, who from that point on worked almost exclusively for her until she took a career break in 2004. Wong's first outfit was a Versace dress and flip-flops, whose modernity came as a surprise to many of her fans who were used to conservative, late 1980s styles. Wong and Kwan also looked at clothes by up-and-coming avant-garde designers such as Dries Van Noten and Martin Margiela.
