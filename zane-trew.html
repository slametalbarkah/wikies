            Zane Trew (born 26 April 2002) is a former professional Australian rules footballer who played for the West Coast Eagles in the Australian Football League (AFL). Trew was drafted by the Eagles at pick 12 in the 2021 rookie draft.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Trew played junior football for Hills Rangers Junior Football Club, becoming the first Australian Football player from Hills Rangers to be drafted to an AFL team. He was educated at Swan Christian College, where Trew's mother teaches. Despite living in Western Australia, Trew barracked for the Sydney Swans growing up. Trew was a talented junior, representing Western Australia in the 2018 Under 16 national championships, and being named in the Midfield in the 2018 Under 16 All Australian Team, averaging 18.7 disposals. Trew was also selected to play for the Australian Under 17 team against the New Zealand Falcons, and unfortunately dislocated his shoulder in the game. After being touted late first round to early second round selection, Trew was surprisingly not selected in the 2020 national draft with teams nervous to select an injury prone player. As a result, he was drafted by the West Coast Eagles with their first selection of the 2021 rookie draft.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== AFL career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2021 ===<br/><br/>Trew debuted for the Eagles WAFL team, making an immediate impact and soon was awarded a one-year contract extension with the club.
