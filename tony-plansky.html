            Anthony Joseph Plansky (June 20, 1900 – February 10, 1979) was an American football running back who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the New York Giants and Boston Braves.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>A native of South Boston, Massachusetts, Plansky attended Georgetown University, where he was a star fullback and decathlete. He was the AAU national decathlon champion in 1924, and won the decathlon event at the prestigious Penn Relays in 1925 and 1926. Planksy was also an accomplished triple jumper, placing 3rd at the 1922 and 1923 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. On the gridiron, he was a member of the 1925 College Football All-America Team and the 1925 All-Eastern football team.<br/><br/>Plansky narrowly missed competing in the decathlon at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In April 1928, he again won the decathlon event at the Penn Relays, which was widely thought to be the Olympic qualifying event, but was later determined not to be.<br/><br/>Plansky played professional football for the NFL's Giants in 1928 and 1929. In his second season, he scored nine touchdowns, two field goals, and two extra points, and was named to the 1929 All-Pro Team. He also played in one game for the 1932 Boston Braves, his final NFL appearance.
