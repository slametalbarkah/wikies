            A papal gentleman, also called a Gentleman of His Holiness, is a lay attendant of the pope and his papal household in Vatican City. Papal gentlemen serve in the Apostolic Palace near St. Peter's Basilica in ceremonial positions, such as escorting dignitaries during state visits and other important occasions. It is a local name for the old court position of valet de chambre. To be appointed is an honor. The appointee is an unpaid volunteer.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Papal Chamberlain was prior to 1968 a court title given by the pope to high-ranking clergy as well as laypersons, usually members of prominent Italian noble families. Many came from families that had long served the Papal Court over the course of several centuries, while others were appointed as a high honor, one of the highest the papacy conferred on Catholic laymen (often prominent politicians or wealthy philanthropists). They were originally selected from members of Italian royal and aristocratic families. They were members of the Papal Court and it was one of the highest honours that could be bestowed on a Catholic layman by the pope.
