            Njongo Lobe Priso Doding (born 24 December 1988) is a Cameroonian professional footballer who plays as a winger for SK Victoria Wanderers FC.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Club career ==<br/><br/>On 9 July 2008, Njongo Priso signed a contract with Valletta, with whom he won Maltese National League 100 Anniversary Cup and Maltese FA Trophy.<br/><br/>In 2010, Cyprus side AEK Larnaca signed Njongo Priso on a season-long loan deal, with an option to make the move permanent. On 30 August 2010, he made his debut as a second-half substitute in a 2–1 defeat of Omonia. He scored his first goal for AEK in a 1–1 draw at Ermis Aradippou on 26 February 2011. At the end of the season, Priso joined AEK on a free transfer, however Valletta agreed to receive a percentage of any future transfer fee.<br/><br/>Priso moved to Bulgarian club CSKA Sofia on 19 January 2012,<br/><br/>for an undisclosed fee believed to be around €320,000. On 25 March, he received a red card in the 3–0 away win over Lokomotiv Plovdiv in an A Group match after an altercation with Dakson. Priso was subsequently banned for seven matches, two for a red card and five due to engaging in confrontation with local police officers in the aftermath of the sending off. The second ban was later reduced from five to two matches on appeal. Priso left CSKA Sofia by mutual agreement on 12 July 2013.
