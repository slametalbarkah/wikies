            Marko Mihkelson (born 30 November 1969) is an Estonian journalist and politician representing the liberal  Reform Party (Renew Europe) in the Parliament of Estonia. Mihkelson was born in Valga, and was first elected to the parliament in 2003 as a member of the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union. He has served in  parliament since 2003 as a Chair of Foreign Affairs Committee, Chair of EU Affairs Committee and Chair of National Defense Committee. On 26 June 2017, he and the former leader of the party Margus Tsahkna announced that they were leaving the party. Mihkelson went on to continue as an independent politician, until joining the Reform Party in September 2018.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>Mihkelson graduated cum laude from the University of Tartu in 1993 as historian. In 1999, Mihkelson received a master's degree on a subject related to the recent history of Russia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Photo scandal ==<br/><br/>On the evening of October 27, 2022, the Postimees online publication published an article in which it was claimed that Mihkelson had taken questionable pictures of his foster children and justified the coverage of the issue with the threat of blackmail to the politician. According to Mihkelson, the publication of the article was related to a custody dispute. The subject had been offered to the press at length, which ruled out the possibility of blackmail, and the photos had been previously examined by specialists who, although they considered them objectionable, did not see in them abuse or anything else that would have given grounds for starting the procedure.
