            A test engineer is a professional who determines how to create a process that would best test a particular product in manufacturing and related disciplines, in order to assure that the product meets applicable specifications. Test engineers are also responsible for determining the best way a test can be performed in order to achieve adequate test coverage. Often test engineers also serve as a liaison between manufacturing, design engineering, sales engineering and marketing communities as well.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Test engineer expertises ==<br/><br/>Test engineers can have different expertise, which depends on what test process they are more familiar with (although many test engineers have full familiarity from the PCB level processes like ICT, JTAG, and AXI) to PCBA and system level processes like board functional test (BFT or FT), burn-in test, system level test (ST). Some of the processes used in manufacturing where a test engineer is needed are:<br/><br/><br/><br/>In-circuit test (ICT)<br/><br/>Stand-alone JTAG test<br/><br/>Automated x-ray inspection (AXI) (also known as X-ray test)<br/><br/>Automated optical inspection (AOI) test<br/><br/>Center of Gravity (CG) test<br/><br/>Continuity or flying probe test<br/><br/>Electromagnetic compatibility or EMI test<br/><br/>(Board) functional test (BFT/FT)<br/><br/>Burn-in test<br/><br/>Environmental stress screening (ESS) test<br/><br/>Highly Accelerated Life Test (HALT)<br/><br/>Highly accelerated stress screening (HASS) test<br/><br/>Insulation test<br/><br/>Ongoing reliability test (ORT)<br/><br/>Regression test<br/><br/>System test (ST)<br/><br/>Vibration test<br/><br/>Final quality audit process (FQA) test<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early project involvement from design phase ==<br/><br/>Ideally, a test engineer's involvement with a product begins with the very early stages of the engineering design process, i.e. the requirements engineering stage and the design engineering stage. Depending on the culture of the firm, these early stages could involve a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Marketing Requirements Document (MRD)—some of the earliest work done during a new product introduction (NPI).<br/><br/>By working with or as part of the NPI group, a test engineer ensures that a product is designed for both testability and manufacturability. In other words, to make sure that the product can be readily tested and built.<br/><br/>The following are some general rules to ensure testability and manufacturability of a product:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Making sure the product has correct label specs and placement that would make it possible for the unit to be traceable and programmable.
