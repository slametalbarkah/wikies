            David Victor Peacock (born 24 May 1945) is an English musician and bass guitarist. He was brought up in the Ponders End and Freezywater areas of Enfield. Peacock is best known as having been one half of the English musical duo Chas &amp; Dave from 1974 until the death of Chas Hodges in 2018<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Earlier in his career in the 1960s, Peacock was in a group called the Rolling Stones (formed in 1960 before the more famous band of the same name), as well as The Tumbleweeds, he also worked with Mick Greenwood and Jerry Donahue. He met Chas Hodges in 1963 when he and his friend gave Hodges a lift home, and became friends when they found they had a similar taste in music. Later in the late 1960s they became part of a group called Black Claw together with Harvey Hinsley and Mick Burt; they recorded tracks with Albert Lee. Black Claw was short-lived, and Peacock left to join a country and western band, while Hodges joined Heads Hands &amp; Feet in 1970.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Chas &amp; Dave ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>In 1972, Peacock and Hodges decided to form a band together which would be the beginning of Chas &amp; Dave. In their early years, they recorded as Oily Rags (cockney rhyming slang for cigarettes - "fags") with Gerry Hogan and Ian Wallace, releasing a self-titled album in 1974. They also worked as session musicians and recorded albums at this time with Oliver Nelson and Teresa Brewer. Both played on Labi Siffre's album Remember My Song in 1975.
