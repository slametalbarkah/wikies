            Whitby Strand was a wapentake and liberty in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England. It was one of thirteen wapentakes across the old North Riding of Yorkshire. The division of the area into the Liberty and Wapentake of Whitby Strand occurred in the 14th century, previous to this, the settlements were in the wapentakes of Langbarugh and Pickering Lythe.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the time of the Norman Conquest, the land that would form the division of Whitby Strand wapentake, belonged to Gospatric, who fled to Scotland, and the confiscated land was given to Hugh Lopas. Lopas disliked the area, so gave it to his friend, William de Percy. William de Percy died in c. 1096 and the granting of the land was confirmed by his son, Alan de Percy (who died c. 1135). Ownership of the region is disputed around that time, as Young states the area belonged to Siward, and that it was divided between the Langbaurgh and Pickering Lythe wapentakes, (to the north and south respectively) as the wapentake did not exist at the time of the Domesday survey. Whitby Strand as a name for the area was not recorded until 1316, and the liberty was composed of four distinct regions: Whitby, Sneaton, The Chapelry of Fylingdales, and Hackness. The title of the liberty and wapentake derives from the Scandinavian name for Whitby – Streonshalh. Historians disagree on the etymology of Streonshalh, though all agree on the language it derives from.
