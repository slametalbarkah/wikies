            Meyer Nilssen Foshaug (15 June 1868 – 6 June 1955) was a Norwegian farmer and politician for the Labour and Social Democratic Labour parties. He served ten terms in the Parliament of Norway.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>He was born at Foshaug in Målselv Municipality as a son of farmers Nils Johnsen Foshaug and Erikka Korneliusdatter. He worked on the family farm from an early age. He was a member of the Målselv municipal council from 1901 to 1904, and was elected to the Parliament of Norway already in the 1903 election, representing the constituency of Tromsø Amt. The Labour Party got its first four parliamentary seats after the 1903 election, all representatives of Northern Norway. In addition to Foshaug, they were Jørg Berge, Alfred Eriksen and John Lind Johansen; also, Adam Egede-Nissen was elected on the Liberal Party ballot. After Norway adopted single-member constituencies, Foshaug was re-elected from the constituency Senjen in 1906, 1909, 1912, 1915 and from Malangen in the 1918 election.<br/><br/>Norway reverted to multi-member constituencies, and Foshaug was elected from the constituency Troms. In 1921, when the Labour Party split in two because of disagreements over the Comintern membership, Foshaug disavowed the pro-Comintern faction and joined the new Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway.
