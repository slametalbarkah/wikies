            In England and Wales, the sus law (from "suspected person") was a stop and search law that permitted a police officer to stop, search and potentially arrest people on suspicion of them being in breach of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824. According to a 2018 study in the British Journal of Criminology, stop and search had a marginal impact on crime in the UK.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== 1824 legislation ==<br/><br/>The power to act on suspicion  was found in part of section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, which provided that:<br/><br/><br/><br/>[E]very suspected person or reputed thief, frequenting any river, canal, or navigable stream, dock, or basin, or any quay, wharf, or warehouse near or adjoining thereto, or any street, highway, or avenue leading thereto, or any place of public resort, or any avenue leading thereto, or any street, or any highway or any place adjacent to a street or highway; with intent to commit an arrestable offence [...] shall be deemed a rogue and vagabond[.]<br/><br/>Upon conviction, a person arrested under the law could be imprisoned for up to three months. This effectively permitted the police to stop and search, and even arrest, anyone found in a public place if they suspected that they intended to commit an offence.<br/><br/>In order to bring a prosecution under the act, the police had to prove that the defendant had committed two acts:<br/><br/><br/><br/>the first, that established them as a "suspected person" (by acting suspiciously), and<br/><br/>the second, that provided intent to commit an arrestable offence.<br/><br/>Two witnesses were required to substantiate the charge, which were usually two police officers patrolling together.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 1970s and 1980s ===<br/><br/>The law caused much discontent among certain sections of the population, particularly black and ethnic minorities, against whom the law was particularly targeted by the police. The sus law had attracted considerable controversy prior to the early 1980s race riots (in St Pauls, Bristol, in 1980, and in Brixton, London; Toxteth, Liverpool; Handsworth, Birmingham; and Chapeltown, Leeds in 1981).<br/><br/>This led to campaigns against the law including the "Scrap Sus" campaign led by Mavis Best and Paul Boateng.<br/><br/>When questioned on the topic in 1980, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir David McNee stated that the reason for its disproportionate use on black people was because they were "over-represented in offences of robbery and other violent theft".<br/><br/>In 1980, the House of Commons' Sub-Committee on Race Relations and Immigration began hearings into the law.
