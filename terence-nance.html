            Terence Nance is artist, musician, and filmmaker born in Dallas, Texas in what was then referred to as the State-Thomas community. He is best known for his directing debut An Oversimplification of Her Beauty, and as the creator of the avant-garde TV program Random Acts of Flyness, which is produced by his production company MVMT for HBO and streams on Max.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Nance was born in Dallas, Texas. He earned his MFA  from New York University where he studied visual art.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Nance wrote, directed, scored, and starred in his first feature film, An Oversimplification of Her Beauty, which incorporates an earlier short film, How Would You Feel?, animation and an original score by Nance and Flying Lotus. It premiered in the Sundance Film Festival's New Frontier section in 2012 and was also screened as part of the 2012 New Directors/New Films Festival in New York.<br/><br/>Scholar Terri Francis has described it as "...an experimental film...that recreates the unspoken space amid friendship and relationships. Starring Terence Nance himself and the girl with whom he is caught up in this difficult dance, the film shifts between reconstruction and reimagining using both animation and live action."<br/><br/>The film was also featured at a screening as part of the Afrofuturist Film Festival at the New School on 3 May 2015.<br/><br/>An Oversimplification of Her Beauty, which premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival and was released theatrically in 2013.
