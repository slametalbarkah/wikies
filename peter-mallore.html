            Sir Peter Mallore (or Mallory; died c. 1380) was a prominent landowner and local politician in fourteenth-century Northamptonshire, who also served as a judge in Ireland. His career was marked by controversy: he was imprisoned on at least two occasions, the second time for assaulting another judge. The troubles of his later years were due largely to the actions of his son Giles, who was accused of wasting the inheritance of his infant stepson and ward. Fortunately for his career, Sir Peter enjoyed the personal regard of a number of influential men, notably the Black Prince and King David II of Scotland.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Family ==<br/><br/>The Mallores were a long-established local family. The earlier Peter Mallore (died 1309), who was a justice of the Court of Common Pleas and one of the five judges who sat on the commission of gaol delivery which tried William Wallace for treason in 1305, was this Peter's cousin.<br/><br/>The younger Peter's father married Margaret Wale of Weedon Pinkeney, Northamptonshire, daughter of Sir Thomas Wale the elder, and eldest sister and heiress of Sir Thomas Wale junior, one of the original knights of the Order of the Garter. On Wale's death in 1352 Peter, as the next male heir, inherited substantial estates, including Litchborough and Weedon Pinkeney.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Politician ==<br/><br/>He played a very active role in local politics: he served on several commissions of oyer and terminer in his native county, and sat as MP for Northamptonshire in the House of Commons in the Parliament of 1351–2.
