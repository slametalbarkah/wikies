<h1>Maurice Freehill</h1>
            
            Squadron Leader Maurice Michael Freehill  (21 January 1899 – 3 February 1939) was a British World War I flying ace credited with seven aerial victories, who went on to serve in the Royal Air Force until his death in 1939.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== World War I ===<br/><br/>Freehill was born in Battersea, London, the son of Eugene and Lilian Freehill. On 20 January 1917, the day before his 18th birthday, he enlisted into the Hampshire Regiment as a private. He soon transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as a cadet, being appointed a probationary temporary second lieutenant on 21 June, and was appointed a flying officer and confirmed in his rank on 13 September.<br/><br/>Posted to No. 46 Squadron RFC, flying the Sopwith Camel, he scored his first victory on 23 March 1918, destroying an enemy aircraft over Bullecourt. On 1 April the Royal Flying Corps merged with the Royal Naval Air Service to form the Royal Air Force, and Freehill's unit became No. 46 Squadron RAF. His next two victories, on 3 and 20 April, were over Albatros C reconnaissance aircraft, both shared with Captain Cecil Marchant. On 30 May he drove down a Fokker Dr.I over Estaires, and then accounted for three Fokker D.VIIs; one each on 7 and 15 August, before transferring to No. 80 Squadron for his seventh and final victory on 3 October, having been appointed temporary captain on 30 September.
