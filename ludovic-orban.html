He was president of the National Liberal Party (PNL) between 2017 and 2021, which expelled him shortly after he lost a bid for another term as its leader. He was also minister of transport from April 2007 to December 2008 in the second Tăriceanu cabinet.<br/><br/>From 2008 to 2016, he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies for Bucharest. He resumed his parliamentary seat within the Chamber of Deputies after the 2020 Romanian legislative election; shortly thereafter, he was elected president of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania. He resigned from this position in October 2021. Two months later, he founded a new centre-right political party, the Force of the Right (FD).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Early life and career ===<br/><br/>Orban was born in the Transylvanian city of Brașov to an ethnic Hungarian father and an ethnic Romanian mother.
