            Takasago Army is the sixth studio album by Taiwanese extreme metal band Chthonic, released in 2011. The title is a reference to the Takasago Volunteers in the Imperial Japanese Army, recruited from the Taiwanese aboriginal tribes during World War II. Takasago (Chinese: 高砂, Japanese: タカサゴ) is an ancient Japanese name for Taiwan. This album serves as the final record in Chthonic's "Souls Reposed" Trilogy.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Theme ===<br/><br/>The album's front cover art depicts a WWII Takasago Army volunteer marking himself as "Seediq" (an act forbidden by the Japanese), although he is now serving in the Japanese military. This illustrates the conflict many of these soldiers had with their identity as Japanese soldiers and their heritage as Taiwanese Seediq warriors.<br/><br/>According to the band's press release statement, "This album, Takasago Army, seeks to expose the part of Taiwan's history that the government attempts to cover up through the interior conflict on identity of former Taiwanese soldiers. The album also seeks to showcase the quest of the Taiwanese for values and dignity as human beings through the tragic roles of the Taiwanese during World War II. Bridging the story of the fourth album Seediq Bale, which took place in 1930, and the story of the fifth album Mirror Of Retribution, which took place in 1947, the latest album Takasago Army, which recounts the story that occurred from 1940 to 1945, was actually the last puzzle of Chthonic's trilogy."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Recording and Production ===<br/><br/>In an interview with Metalship, Freddy Lim commented on the band's songwriting process for Takasago Army, saying: "In the early years, we played a kind of metal like the western kind. And the more we played, the more we put Taiwanese elements into the music. All particularly in the new album Takasago Army, the whole 'writing' philosophy has been changed. We used to write metal, and then add some Taiwanese feelings and emotions, but this time I write Taiwanese songs.
