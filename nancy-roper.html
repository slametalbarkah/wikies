            Nancy Roper (1918–2004) was a British nurse theorist, lexicographer and creator with Winifred W. Logan and Alison J. Tierney of the Roper–Logan–Tierney model of nursing used widely in nurse training in the United Kingdom, USA and Europe, since mid-1970s.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and early career ==<br/><br/>Nancy Roper was born on 29 September 1918, at Wetheral, near Carlisle, England, her mother  was a nanny.  Roper had wanted to be a nurse as a child. Her initial training was as a registered sick children's nurse (gaining a gold medal at Booth Hall Hospital, Manchester).<br/><br/>After this she trained as a state registered (adult) nurse in 1943, winning student nurse medals at Leeds General Infirmary. Roper was called up to the Territorial Army as a nurse teacher, in World War II, although teaching was a reserved occupation. Her next role was as a teaching staff nurse, and then senior tutor at Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, following completing a sister tutor diploma from London University in 1950.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Later career ==<br/><br/>Roper was invited to join the Royal College of Nursing study tour in Belgium in 1954. She became an Examiner for the General Nursing Council. She also worked on updating the Oakes Dictionary for Nurses, which was published in 1961.
