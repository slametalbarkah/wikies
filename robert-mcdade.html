            Robert Alexander McDade (August 11, 1922 – October 14, 2009) was a United States Army colonel. He is best known for commanding the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment during the Battle of la Drang in 1965, during the Vietnam War.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Military career ==<br/><br/>McDade was one of relatively few officers to serve with an infantry unit in three wars – the South Pacific in World War II, where he commanded a rifle platoon, the Korean War, where he commanded a rifle company, and the Vietnam War, where he commanded an infantry battalion. He was wounded in action four times. Besides his combat assignments, Mcdade held military posts in Washington, D.C., New York City, Germany and Panama.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Battle of Ia Drang ===<br/><br/>The Battle of la Drang was the first major battle between the United States Army and the People's Army of Vietnam, referred to by U.S. fighting units as the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), during the Vietnam War. The two-part battle began on November 14, 1965, and was focused on landing zone (LZ) X-Ray. This part of the battle was fought primarily by the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), led by Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, although elements of Alpha and Bravo Companies of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry (2/7), participated. The rest of the 2/7 arrived by the morning of November 16.<br/><br/>Only three weeks before the battle, Lieutenant Colonel McDade had been the 1st Cavalry Division's personnel officer, and had not commanded troops in ten years.
