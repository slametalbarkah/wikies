            Ulhas (born M. N. Kaul; 1913 – 14 July 1969) was an Indian actor, who played character roles in Hindi cinema from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. However, since he died in 1969, many of his films were released after his death.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Personal life ==<br/><br/>Ulhas was born as M N Kaul at Ajmer in a Kashmiri Pandit family in the year 1913 to Chand Bahadur Kaul, who in turn was the brother of Kamla Nehru. This makes Ulhas, the first cousin of Indira Gandhi who was the third Prime Minister of India. He was also distantly related to actor Prem Adib. After completing his formal education, Ulhas left for Poona with the help of Prem Adib to try his luck in the Hindi film industry.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ulhas came to Poona in search of work in 1935. After the initial struggle, he soon got his first film titled Wahan, with the help of fellow actor Chandra Mohan, who also happened to be another Kashmiri Pandit. Wahan was being made under the banner of Prabhat Film Company headed by V. Shantaram and directed by K Narayan Kale. Ulhas came into prominence with Basant (1942) in which he was cast opposite Mumtaz Shanti.
